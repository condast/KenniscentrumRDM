<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophone">Hydrophonics</a> involves research and application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_acoustics">soundwaves under water</a>. Typically frequencies up to 200 kHz can travel under water over large distances, 
although especially the very low frequencies (VLF) have an enormous reach.</p>
<p>The applied research on hydrophonics initially started out as a spin-off for the research in aquatic drones, as we aimed to develop sensors that could detect the sound of
ships, quays, marine life and other potential risks and obstacles for autonomous vessels.</p>
<p>The ininital research however soon introduced us to thrilling new research and applications that seemd to have revived
the interest in hydrophonics world-wide. New <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity">piezo-electrical elements</a> and <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">cheap high-end microcontrollers</a> are paving the way for new innovations in
this field.</p>
<p>Soon after the research started, the first spin-off introduced itself through a request for a <i>drowned persons detection system</i>, requested by <a href="http://www.koninklijkeschuttevaer.nl/">Koniklijke Schuttevaer</a>, the Dutch foundation for inland skippers. Victor	Rebagliato Monsonís, 
a Spanish exchange student from the <a href="https://www.upv.es/index-en.html">Polytechnic University of Valencia</a>, designed the <a href="https://github.com/condast/KenniscentrumRDM/blob/master/Projects/Hydrophonics/Chrrb/Badge/Drowning%20Detection%20System2.pdf?row=true"><i>CHRRB system</i></a>, 
the Customisable Hydrophonic Rescue and Recovery Badge, which is aimed to be carried on board at all times, 
and which will sound an alarm if someone falls overboard. Victor used 3D- printing technology for rapid prototyping,
 and managed to improve the design over four iterations.Currently the electronics  and software is being developed.</p>
 <p>Another team of students, Rutger van Aalst and Ines Simic, managed to adapt a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_problem"><i>Cocktail Party Algorithm</i></a> to detect whether sounds coming from two hydrophones are in fact from the same source, and developed a filter to filter this sound. 
 This can be very useful to dampen the sounds that a ship creates when deploying hydrophones in real environments.</p>
